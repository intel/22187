dpc_reduce Sample

Purpose
The dpc_reduce is a simple program that calculates pi.  This program is implemented using C++ and Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) for Intel(R) CPU and accelerators.

This example demonstrates how to do reduction by using the CPU in serial mode, 
the CPU in parallel mode (using TBB), the GPU using direct DPC++ coding, the 
GPU using multiple steps with DPC++ Library algorithms transform and reduce, 
and then finally using the DPC++ Library transform_reduce algorithm.  

All the different modes use a simple calculation for Pi.   It is a well known 
mathematical formula that if you integrate from 0 to 1 over the function, 
(4.0 / (1+x*x) )dx the answer is pi.   One can approximate this integral 
by summing up the area of a large number of rectangles over this same range.  

Each of the different function calculates pi by breaking the range into many 
tiny rectangles and then summing up the results. 

The parallel computations are performed using oneTBB and oneAPI DPC++ library 
(oneDPL).
