## Description

This sample implements the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial tree model that is used in the finance field for American exercise options with five Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho). The simple idea is to model all possible assets price paths using a binomial tree.

## Design Details

### Design Inputs

This design reads inputs from the `ordered_inputs.csv` file. The inputs are:

| Input                             | Description
---                                 |---
| `nSteps`                          | Number of time steps in the binomial tree. The maximum `nSteps` in this design is 8191.
| `CP`                              | -1 or 1 represents put and call options, respectively.
| `Spot`                            | Spot price of the underlying price.
| `Fwd`                             | Forward price of the underlying price.
| `Strike`                          | Exercise price of the option.
| `Vol`                             | Percent volatility that the design reads as a decimal value.
| `DF`                              | `Spot` or `Fwd`
| `T`                               | Time, in years, to the maturity of the option.

### Design Outputs

This design writes outputs to the `ordered_outputs.csv` file. The outputs are:

| Output                            | Description
---                                 |---
| `value`                           | Option price
| `delta`                           | Measures the rate of change of the theoretical option value with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price.
| `gamma`                           | Measures the rate of change in the `delta` with respect to changes in the underlying price.
| `vega`                            | Measures sensitivity to volatility.
| `theta`                           | Measures the sensitivity of the value of the derivative to the passage of time.
| `rho`                             | Measures sensitivity to the interest of rate.

### Design Correctness

This design tests the correctness by comparing the FPGA results and CPU results.

### Design Performance

This design tests the FPGA performance to determine how many assets can be processed per second, with five valid inputs. Five inputs are sufficient to test the performance.

## Building the CRR Design (Linux)

Perform the following steps:

  

1. Install the design into the `build` directory from the design directory by running `cmake`:

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

    If you are compiling for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

    ```
    cmake ..
    ```

    If instead you are compiling for the Intel® PAC with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

    ```
    cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
    ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following four build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

    * Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device). It runs one input data from the input file for emulation.

        ```
        make fpga_emu
        ./crr.fpga_emu ./src/data/ordered_inputs.csv -o=./src/data/ordered_outputs.csv
        ```

    * Generate HTML optimization report. You can find the report in `crr_report.prj/reports/crr_report.html`.

        ```
        make report
        ```

    * Compile and run on the FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device). It runs all the input data from the input file.

        ```
        make fpga
        ./crr.fpga ./src/data/ordered_inputs.csv -o=./src/data/ordered_outputs.csv
        ```

(Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, an Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA precompiled binary can be downloaded <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/crr.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

## Building the CRR Design (Windows)

Perform the following steps:
Note: `cmake` is not yet supported on Windows, a build.ninja file is provided instead.

1. Enter source file directory.

```
cd src
```

2. Compile the design. The following four build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

    * Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device). It runs one input data from the input file for emulation.

        ```
        ninja fpga_emu
        crr.fpga_emu.exe ./data/ordered_inputs.csv -o=./data/ordered_outputs.csv
        ```

    * Generate HTML optimization report. You can find the report in `../src/crr_report.prj/reports/report.html`.

        ```
        ninja report
        ```

        If you are targeting the Intel® PAC with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA, please use the following target and find the report in `../src/crr_s10_pac_report.prj/reports/report.html`.

        ```
        ninja report_s10_pac
        ```

    *  **Not supported yet:** Compile and run on the FPGA hardware.
