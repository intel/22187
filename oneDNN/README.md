| Component | oneDNN_SYCL_InterOps      | This C++ API example demonstrates oneDNN SYCL extensions API programming model by using a custom SYCL kernel and a ReLU operation . |
| Component | oneDNN_CNN_FP32_Inference | This C++ API example demonstrates building/runing a simple CNN fp32 inference against different oneDNN pre-built binarie. |
| Component | oneDNN_Getting_Started.ipynb|This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to compile a oneDNN sample with different releases via batch jobs on the Intel oneAPI DevCloud (check below Notice)|
| Component | oneDNN_CPU2GPU_Porting.ipynb|This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to port a oneDNN sample from CPU-only version to CPU&GPU version by using DPC++ on the Intel oneAPI DevCloud (check below Notice)|
>  Notice : Please use Intel oneAPI DevCloud as the environment for jupyter notebook samples. \
Users can refer to [DevCloud Getting Started](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/) for using DevCloud \
Users can use JupyterLab from DevCloud via "One-click Login in", and download samples via "git clone" or the "oneapi-cli" tool \
Once users are in the JupyterLab with downloaded jupyter notebook samples, they can start following the steps without further installion needed.
