# Hello decode

This sample shows how to use the oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) to
perform a simple video encode.

| Optimized for   | Description
|---------------- | ----------------------------------------
| OS              | Ubuntu* 18.04; Windows* 10
| Hardware        | Intel® Processor Graphics GEN9 or newer
| Software        | Intel® oneAPI Video Processing Library(oneVPL)

## What You Will Learn

- How to use oneVPL to encode an I420 raw video file to H.265.


## Time to Complete

  5 minutes


## Sample Details

This sample is a command line application that takes a file containing a raw
I420 format video elementary stream as an argument, encodes it with oneVPL
writes the decoded output to `out.h265` in H.265 format.


| Configuration     | Default setting
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------
| Target device     | CPU
| Input format      | I420
| Output format     | H.265 video elementary stream
| Output resolution | same as input


## Build and Run the Sample

To build and run the sample you need to install prerequisite software and set up
your environment.

### Install Prerequisite Software

 - Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit for Windows* or Linux*
 - [CMake](https://cmake.org)
 - A C/C++ compiler


### Set Up Your Environment

#### Linux

Run `setvars.sh` every time you open a new terminal window:

The `setvars.sh` script can be found in the root folder of your oneAPI
installation, which is `/opt/intel/oneapi/` when installed as root, and
`~/intel/oneapi/` when installed as a normal user.  If you customized the
installation folder, the `setvars.sh` is in your custom location.

To use the tools, whether from the command line or using Eclipse, initialize
your environment. To do it in one step for all tools, use the included
environment variable setup utility:

```
source <install_dir>/setvars.sh
```


#### Windows

Run `setvars.bat` every time you open a new command prompt:

The `setvars.bat` script can be found in the root folder of your oneAPI
installation, which is typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\inteloneapi\` when
installed using default options. If you customized the installation folder, the
`setvars.bat` is in your custom location.

To use the tools,from the command line initialize your environment. Note that if
a compiler is not part of your oneAPI installation you should run in a Visual
Studio 64-bit command prompt. To do it in one step for all tools, use the
included environment variable setup utility:

```
<install_dir>\setvars.bat
```


### Build the Sample

From the directory containing this README:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```


### Run the Sample

```
cmake --build . --target run
```

The run target runs the sample executable with the arguments
`<sample_dir>/content/cars_128x96.i420 128 96`.

You can find the output file `out.h265` in the build directory.

### Display the Output

You can display the output with a video player that supports raw streams such as
FFplay. You can use the following command to display the output with FFplay:

```
ffplay out.h265
```
